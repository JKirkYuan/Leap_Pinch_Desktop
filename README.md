# Pinch Drawing with LeapMotion (Unity Modules were Deprecated)

This is the repo where I will explore the detections utilities! Unfortunately all of the detection demos were made by Leap Motion are
for VR, I created my own version that can be used for Desktop Users. :tada: :tada:

```bash

# Installation
INSTALL UNITY 5.5! This is the only version I have tested. ðŸ’»

# Cloning and setup
git clone https://github.com/JKirkYuan/Leap_Pinch_Desktop.git

# Find and Load the Scenes
In Unity open the folder that you cloned and
go into Assets > LeapMotion > Scenes > Leap_Pinch_Demo_Desktop <-- Open this Unity File


```

### Issues
Must update everything!! All older modules have been deprecated
Currently Leap Motion Orion is in Beta and does not work with MacOS :frowning: </br>

I can't believe they deprecated this omg :frowning:
